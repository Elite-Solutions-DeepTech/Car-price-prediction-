# Revving Into The Future : Car Price Prediction 

### ABSTARCT:
This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting used car prices. With the increasing demand for pre-owned vehicles, accurate price prediction becomes imperative for both buyers and sellers. The dataset comprises various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and location, collected from diverse sources. After preprocessing and feature engineering, several machine learning algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests are employed to build predictive models. The models are evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared value. Additionally, techniques like feature importance analysis are utilized to identify the most influential factors affecting car prices. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately predicting used car prices, thereby providing valuable insights for both consumers and dealers in the pre-owned car market.
